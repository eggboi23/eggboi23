## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Growing up, I have always had an interest in computers and technology.

When my parents upgraded from using flip phones to iPhones, I always begged them to let me use it so I can play app games on it or simply be blown away by how the touch sceen works. When my brother got his first laptop, I borrowed it to browse the internet and visit all the different websites I knew.

Going into high school my freshman year, I took a computer programming class, and I absolutely loved it! My final project was a very bare bones brick breaker game, but the sense of enjoyment and accomplishment in creating a project from scratch using what I know was exhilarating!

Now, I am a freshman studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and I can't wait to see what I will learn and develop in the future!

Currently, I'm learning web development, and focusing on building my own website!
